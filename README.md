Pixelated game exercise of Tower of Hanoi

This game was a small sample project by Brad K. and Rebecca H.

Official Title: Temple of Hanoi

Temple of Hanoi is based off the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with adjustable difficulty and random factor.

All of the art, music and code was written by the above two individuals.

I recommend lowering the volume, this was an interesting first attempt at music to say the least.
